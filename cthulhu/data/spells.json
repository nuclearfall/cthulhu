            "officialDescription": "A portion of the caster\u2019s life essence, or \"ka,\" is transferred into one of his or her vital organs. The enchanted organ is then removed from the caster\u2019s body, to be hidden away for safekeeping and providing the wizard with a form of invulnerability\u2014as long as the enchanted organ remains safely hidden the wizard will not suffer particular attacks and may even be invulnerable to death.\n     This spell was first used by followers of the Dark Pharaoh, Nephren-Ka, who would remove a vital organ, such as the heart or liver, and lock them away in safe places. This would make the caster virtually impossible to kill, if not for the spell\u2019s one weakness. The brain is the seat of the spell\u2019s power and, as such, could not be removed. If the brain was destroyed, the other organs would lose their magical properties and the caster would die.\n     Having one\u2019s own insides removed costs 2D10 Sanity points and the permanent loss of 5 POW per organ removed. Attacks that impale cause only normal damage (unless the head is specifically targeted). Invulnerability stems from which organ is removed; for example if the lungs are removed then the caster is unaffected by lack of oxygen (thus drowning and suffocation are no longer threats). Removal of vital organs may also render the caster immune to poison and so forth.\n     If the caster is harmed, hit points should be reduced as usual, leading to unconsciousness but not death. Death will only occur if the brain is specifically targeted and destroyed.",

For the spell to take effect the caster must succeed in an opposed POW roll with the target. Intense, wracking pains seize the target, the face and hands blister and drip fluid, and the eyes cloud with blood and become temporarily sightless. The target is rendered completely helpless during the period of the spell\u2019s effect.\n     The effect lasts 1D6 rounds, after which sight returns. In 3D10 minutes, the target fully recovers and can resume normal activity. Traces of physical corruption fade quickly and in 24 hours only faint blemishes can be seen on the skin. Each such experience costs the target 1/1D6+1 Sanity points.",
