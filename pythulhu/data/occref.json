Some are merely opportunistic jacks of all trades, such as pickpockets and thugs, while others are highly specialized, spending time researching and planning focused criminal enterprises. This latter group could include bank robbers, cat burglars, forgers, and confidence tricksters.\n\nThe criminal either works for someone, usually an organized \"mob\" or crime family, or works solo, perhaps oc- casionally teaming up with others when the reward is worth the effort and risk. Freelance thugs might work as muggers, stickup men, and armed robbers.\n\nWhether bootleggers, corner-boys, or thugs, these are the soldiers of organized crime. They are supported by criminal organizations and they are the ones usually expected to take the fall for the gangsters above them. Their silence and loyalty is expected and rewarded.\n\nConfidence tricksters are usually smooth talkers. Working alone or in a team, they descend on wealthy individuals or communities, fleecing their targets of their hard-earned savings. Some schemes are elaborate, involving teams of scam men and rented Buildings; others are simple affairs, transactions requiring only one con man and no more than a few minutes.\n\nA fence is someone who trades in stolen property, usu- ally taking in stolen goods and then selling them onto other criminals or (unwitting) legitimate customers. Principally a middleman between thieves and buyers, the fence either takes a cut of the profit or, more usually, buys the stolen goods at a very low price.\n\nForgers are the artists of the criminal world, specializing in forging official documents, deeds and transfers, and providing phony signatures. Beginners work manufacturing fake ID's for petty criminals, while the best engrave plates for counterfeiting currency.\n\nHit men are the cold-blooded killers of the underworld. Usually hired from somewhere out of town, they arrive, do their work, then quickly disappear. It\u2019s strictly business. Often sociopaths, who seem to lack the ability to empathize with other human beings. Many follow strict codes of behavior. In spite of this, many marry, raise children, and in all other ways behave like model citizens.\n\nSmuggling is always a lucrative and high-risk business. The smuggler usually has a public profession, such as boat captain, pilot, or businessman, allowing them to transport illicit products to a needy market.\n\nStreet punks are typically young street hoods, possibly looking for a chance to hook-up with real gangsters. Experience is probably limited to stealing cars, shoplifting, mugging, and burglary.",

A similar situation exists in England, with touring repertory companies traveling the counties, with London the heart of theatrical shows. Touring companies travel by train, presenting new plays, as well as classics by Shakespeare and others. Some companies spend consider- able amounts of time touring foreign parts, such as Canada, Hawaii, Australia, and Europe.\n\nWith the introduction of \"talkies\" in the latter part of the 1920s, many stars of the silent films era cannot cope with the transition to sound.

Although many sailors serve in the traditional roles of Boatswain\u2019s Mate or Fireman rating (ship\u2019s engine man), the Navy also has a need for technically trained mechanics, radio operators, air controllers, etc. The highest enlisted rank is Chief Petty Officer, which carries with it a prestige respected by even high-ranking officers. Enlistments are for a fixed number of years\u2014in the U.S. Navy this is usually four years of active duty followed by two years of inactive reserve commitment, during which time the sailor can be called to serve in times of national emergency. \n\nCommercial sailors may work aboard a fishing vessel, charter boat, or haulage tankers, carrying oil or commodi- ties. In the U.S., charter boats work both coasts, as well as on the Great Lakes, catering to sport fisherman and vacationers. By far the greatest number of charter boats are found in Florida, on both the Gulf and ocean coasts.\n\nDuring Prohibition, many a charter boat captain found a lucrative trade in ferrying thirsty customers to the 3-mile limit, where foreign ships could sell alcohol. Likewise, smuggling for the bootleggers could pay well; however, the risks were high.",

Many stars are made overnight and most of them lead flashy, high profile lives, ever in the media spotlight.\n\nIn the 1920s, the theatrical center of the U.S. is in New York City, although there are major stages in most cities across the country. A similar situation exists in England, with touring repertory companies traveling the counties, with London the heart of theatrical shows. Touring companies travel by train, presenting new plays, as well as classics by Shakespeare and others. Some companies spend consider- able amounts of time touring foreign parts, such as Canada, Hawaii, Australia, and Europe.\n\nWith the introduction of \"talkies\" in the latter part of the 1920s, many stars of the silent films era cannot cope with the transition to sound. The arm-waving histrionics of silent actors give way to more subtle characterizations. John Gar- field and Francis Bushman are forgotten for new stars, such as Gary Cooper and Joan Crawford.",
